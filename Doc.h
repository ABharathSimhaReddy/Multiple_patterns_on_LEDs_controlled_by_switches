                  ASSIGNMENT 2 -> LED Pattern Generator using Digital Keypad Input
 
NAME: A Bharath Simha Reddy.
Date: 30 November 2025

DESCRIPTION

This project implements an LED pattern generator using PORTB of a PIC microcontroller.
The user can select one of four LED patterns using a Digital Keypad.
Each key press loads a pattern, and PORTB displays the selected pattern continuously until another key is pressed.

The program uses software delay counters to control pattern speed and uses keypad state-change detection for clean input handling.
Each LED pattern is implemented in a separate function for modularity.

FEATURES

Keypad-based Pattern Selection
Switch1 loads Pattern 1
Switch2 loads Pattern 2
Switch3 loads Pattern 3
Switch4 loads Pattern 4

Four Distinct LED Patterns
Pattern 1: Forward and reverse shifting with bit build-up
Pattern 2: Forward shift and wipe
Pattern 3: Alternating 0xAA and 0x55
Pattern 4: Alternating upper nibble and lower nibble

Clean Key Detection
Uses STATE_CHANGE detection to avoid repeated triggers
Ensures one output per press

Modular Design
Each pattern is implemented in a separate function
Initialization is handled by init_config

Safe Digital Configuration
ADC ports disabled
PORTB configured as output
PORTC lower nibble used for keypad input

VARIABLES
int delay

Software delay counter used to control LED pattern switching speed.

int i

Step counter used to determine which part of the pattern sequence is running.

unsigned char key

Stores detected key value from the digital keypad.

int flag

Holds the number representing the selected pattern.

FILES USED

main.h
Contains ON and OFF macro definitions.

DK.h
Contains keypad macros, keypad pin configuration, and function prototypes.

main.c
Contains pattern functions, keypad handling, and main control loop.

FUNCTION DOCUMENTATION

Function: init_config

Initializes all modules required for LED pattern operation.

Steps:

Configure ADCON1 to make pins digital.

Set PORTB as output.

Clear PORTB.

Initialize digital keypad.

Function: pattern1

Implements a 32-step LED animation pattern on PORTB.

Sequence:

Turn on bits from LSB to MSB.

Shift bits left.

Turn on bits in reverse direction.

Shift bits right.

Reset after completing 32 steps.

Delay is handled using a decreasing counter.

Function: pattern2

Implements a 16-step LED animation.

Sequence:

Turn on bits from LSB to MSB.

Shift bits left.

Reset after 16 steps.

Function: pattern3

Implements a flashing alternating bit pattern.

Sequence:

Load 0xAA (10101010)

Load 0x55 (01010101)

Toggle between them after each delay cycle.

Function: pattern4

Implements nibble-based flashing pattern.

Sequence:

Load 0xF0 (11110000)

Load 0x0F (00001111)

Toggle between these two patterns.

Function: main

Serves as the core control loop for the system.

Steps:

Initialize system configuration.

Continuously read keypad input using state-change mode.

Update the pattern selection based on key pressed.

Execute the corresponding pattern function.

Default state clears PORTB.

KEYPAD LOGIC OVERVIEW

Switch1 sets flag to 1 ? Pattern 1
Switch2 sets flag to 2 ? Pattern 2
Switch3 sets flag to 3 ? Pattern 3
Switch4 sets flag to 4 ? Pattern 4
Any other condition keeps the previous pattern running.

APPLICATIONS

LED animations using microcontroller

Interactive pattern generators

Keypad-controlled display systems

Educational embedded system experiments

CONCLUSION

This project demonstrates the use of keypad-driven control logic to manage multiple LED patterns efficiently.
The modular design ensures easy expansion and modification of LED patterns.
Using separate pattern functions and clean keypad input handling makes the system stable and user-friendly.
