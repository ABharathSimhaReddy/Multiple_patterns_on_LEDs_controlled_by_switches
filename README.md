# Multiple_patterns_on_LEDs_controlled_by_switches
This Embedded C project demonstrates controlling 8 LEDs using a digital keypad. Each key press triggers a unique LED pattern: left-to-right &amp; back, sequential on/off, alternate blinking, and nibble-wise blinking. The project showcases GPIO control, timing using delays, and interactive embedded system programming.
